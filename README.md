## PHYS 511 Nuclear Physics Coding Lab

This github repository will be fully ready by our class in April, but in the meantime it will serve as a guide on all the pre-class pieces we need to put together. Below is a guide on how to properly prepare yourself and your computer for our labs at that time.

### Purpose Behind Coding Lab

This lab is meant to teach you both basic programming in python as well as see how it can be applied in a nuclear physics setting. We deal with immense amounts of data which can only be effectively analyzed through programming, and while the languages vary between C++, Java, Fortran, and Python, analyses in python are becoming more common. Jupyter Notebooks also provide an excellent platform for quick results and feedback on your code. 


## Getting Working Python and Jupyter Notebooks

-   [ ] Get [conda](#conda-install) installed and running
-   [ ] Get [jupyter notebooks](#jupyter-notebook-packages) and packages installed :arrow_left: If you're alreay familiar with python and have it on your computer

### Conda install

Documentation on installing conda for your operating system is located [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

### Jupyter Notebook Install

Documentation on installing Jupyter Notebooks is located [here](https://jupyter.org/install)

### Success Check

Once you have successfully gotten Jupyter Notebooks operational, try running the test file in the repository to make sure everything is working as needed. If you run into issues please feel free to contact me: mclauchc@email.sc.edu
